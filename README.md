## CS50 Final Project
### Nocturanl Meditations Blog Website
  Welcome to my CS50 final project. The end state goal for this project is a website hosted on either Azure, AWS, or google cloud where I can post essays about different topics and then meta essays trying to connect the different essays togather as a way of making sense of the world and connecting the dots of what is really going on. I do not intend to submit the goal of what I really want this blog to be in fact as of doing this final project I have only written two of the essays that the blog will feature. The goal is that this will be a life long hobby of making this web app/site the best it can be and just really being I a place I can get my thoughts out there in anynous way. I plan on changing domain names after submitting. 

*Implementation*
This blog website will be a flask based web app using the bootstrap frame work. Additionally I will trying to implement a SQLite database to create a list of "subscribers" to get emails for theoretical news letter that will come later on down the road and being as when I submit this project I won't have any will be an empty database but the framework will be there.
